HI THERE!! hehe my name is N - or Fin but.. preferably N!
I'm a **fictionkin** if you couldn't tell :Ã¾ â˜….â€¢.â˜…

I love playing pony town and I'm always on there with my husband!! hehe if you do catch us making ou- *sitting around* don't be afraid to say hi >:3 I don't bite... 
Though if I do come off as rude I apologise heh ðŸ˜… â˜….â€¢.â˜…

**DNI STUFF:** If you like Panic AU, I do not have anything towards you but it's the AU that's the problem, especially because I'm a N fictkin
Also if you're a TUT skin, sorry but.. I'd rather enjoy seeing someones attempt at an MD pony even if it looks "bad" rather than an overused and tbh *ugly* tut skin. It crosses the line if you decide to claim it as your own ðŸ˜¬ And then there's ppl who say odd things about me and @uzihell's relationship, we are **NOT** roleplayers so if you say anything such as (and it's happened before) "You should've picked someone better" or "How long until *our names* break up?" then roll command, please jump it's really disrespectful and you don't know how we might react to it so shut up and leave us alone â˜….â€¢.â˜…
